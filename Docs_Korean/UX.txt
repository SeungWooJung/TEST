Rapid developments in the market didn¡¯t just leave scars, it also brought much needed learning and wisdom. Blockchain industry as a whole is making remarkable progress: not only in advancing the underlying technologies, and also in how we evaluate those visions unlocked by them. We believe we now have a firm grasp on the blockchain dream; what¡¯s important now is how we bring it about from the metaphysical realm into the physical world, how to give it life so it could live and breathe among the people, doing its job to change and innovate the world we live in. In that sense, we¡¯ve come to value pragmatism in blockchain. Just as we value decentralization and transparency, we now also expect to learn from blockchain projects what the resulting products will look like, how they will go to market, how they plan to build a sustainable business, and how they will progress forward with mid- and long-term goals. Blockchain projects focusing on designing innovative futures are being challenged to validate their present business worth under a more rational lens, and will continue to face demands to prove their capability to deliver live products, their caliber to grow their business, and their integrity and their standard of business ethics. Only those projects who meet the raised bar will continue to trailblaze the next frontier of blockchain industry.
