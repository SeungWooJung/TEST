Enterprises with massive user base joining the mass adoption front is definitely a major milestone for the blockchain industry, but the event by itself does not guarantee blockchain businesses will find themselves visited more frequently by paying customers, or that they will start seeing improved bottom line. What we will see is growth in total addressable market - or users that can potentially be reached. Blockchain mass adoption still requires businesses to overcome the nontrivial challenges of user conversion and retention. The only way we can truly guarantee blockchain mass adoption with certainty is, of course, by building great blockchain products. Only when we deliver apps and services that embrace blockchain values at its core design but with such polish and usability that they are inseparable from user¡¯s daily routines, only at that level of retention will we find user base build up in support for the product, that those groups grow to become user communities, generate interactive user behavior data in meaningful volume, ultimately leading up to user insights that start a virtuous cycle of product evolution. Klaytn believes that only when we deliver those products will we be able to establish a stable, healthy industry populated by a wide range of businesses, institutions, and governments. Only when we build that greater ecosystem will we see the benefits of technology reach the larger mass of our race. To that end, we continue our challenge to solve the technical hurdles that blockchain faces. 
 Klaytn exists to make blockchain easy to use for businesses and the end-users
